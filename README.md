# VoiceMaker - AI Voice Conversion Application

Transform audio and text into any voice using AI-powered voice cloning technology.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This application requires **Python 3.11 or lower**. Python 3.13 is not currently supported by Coqui TTS. See [PYTHON_VERSION.md](PYTHON_VERSION.md) for setup instructions.

## 🎯 Features

- **Voice Cloning**: Clone any voice from just 3-30 seconds of reference audio
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert text to speech in the cloned voice
- **Audio-to-Audio**: Transform existing audio to match a reference voice
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with glassmorphism design
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy file uploads with drag-and-drop support
- **Real-time Preview**: Listen to generated audio instantly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 - 3.11** (Python 3.13 is NOT supported - see [PYTHON_VERSION.md](PYTHON_VERSION.md))
- (Optional) CUDA-compatible GPU for faster processing

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd voicemaker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note**: First installation will download ~1-2GB of AI models. This is a one-time download.

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Reference Voice
- Click or drag-and-drop an audio file (3-30 seconds recommended)
- This is the voice that will be cloned
- Supported formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A

### Step 2: Choose Conversion Mode

#### Text-to-Speech Mode
1. Switch to the "Text to Speech" tab
2. Enter the text you want to convert (up to 5000 characters)
3. Click "Convert to Speech"

#### Audio-to-Audio Mode
1. Switch to the "Audio to Audio" tab
2. Upload the audio file you want to convert
3. Click "Convert Audio"

### Step 3: Download Result
- Listen to the generated audio in the player
- Click "Download Audio" to save the result

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Storage**: 5GB free space

### Recommended for Best Performance
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 10GB free space

## 🔧 Performance Notes

- **With GPU**: 1-3 seconds per sentence
- **Without GPU (CPU only)**: 5-15 seconds per sentence
- **First run**: Slower due to model download and initialization

## 🎨 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Coqui TTS (XTTS v2)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript
- **AI Model**: XTTS v2 (Multilingual voice cloning)

## 📝 Supported Audio Formats

**Input**: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A  
**Output**: WAV (high quality, uncompressed)

## ⚠️ Ethical Usage Guidelines

This tool can clone voices from short audio samples. Please ensure:

- ✅ You have permission to use any voice samples
- ✅ You comply with local laws regarding voice synthesis
- ✅ You use this technology responsibly and ethically
- ❌ Do not use for impersonation, fraud, or deception
- ❌ Do not create misleading or harmful content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Model loading failed"
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for first-time model download
- Check that you have sufficient disk space (~5GB)

### "CUDA not available" warning
- This is normal if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU
- The application will use CPU (slower but functional)

### Slow processing
- First run is always slower (model initialization)
- Consider using a GPU for better performance
- Reduce text length or audio duration

### "Invalid audio file" error
- Ensure your audio file is in a supported format
- Try converting your audio to WAV format
- Check that the audio file is not corrupted
